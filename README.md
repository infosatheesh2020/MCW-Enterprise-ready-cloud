# Enterprise-ready cloud

Trey Research is a manufacturing company that builds consumer products with 29.6 billion USD in annual revenue. Trey's headquarters are in New Jersey, but they have datacenters and branch offices scattered across the United States; with several major offices in the United Kingdom, France, and Japan.

Even as large as it is, Trey seeks to maximize the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of its IT, especially in new projects and business units. With a dizzying number of existing business units; each with their own unique requirements from IT and ballooning costs from internal hardware and datacenter investment, Trey is looking to the cloud.

Trey is interested in a large-scale solution that will help mitigate creeping costs and start the transition to a modern cloud-based enterprise architecture using a solid set of controls for governance.

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop you will create an Azure Cloud Governance plan to advise a manufacturing company of the features available in Azure. You will discover features to bring governance to their Azure deployments, distributed administration, and allowance for secure remote connectivity and development work for their offshore developers. 

At the end of the workshop, you will be better able to design a governance plan to showcase the security and governance features of Azure and control costs. In addition, you'll learn how to provide for cost tracking by business unit, environment, and project, provide for a distributed administration model, put a service catalog in place to prevent deployment of unsupported Azure services, and put controls in place to allow deployment of services only in specific regions.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you are working with Trey Research to setup some best practices regarding policies, permissions, and remote access to their network.  Tasks include creating scripts that Enterprise IT will use to automatically set policy and delegate permissions when a new subscription is created. You will help them solve a critical problem for on-boarding new developers and controlling access to what they can access on the network.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will know how to provide cost tracking by business unit, environment and project, provide for a distributed administration model, put a service catalog in place to prevent deployment of unsupported Azure services, and put controls in place to allow deployment of services only in specific regions.
